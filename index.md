## Returning to Church

Dear Chorley 3rd Ward,

You will all be aware that we are now in a lockdown situation once again. I know this is disappointing to many and will cause significant hardship for some. Health concerns are only the most obvious of these challenges, job security, home management, home schooling, isolation and many other matters come along with this. I am confident this decision has been taken with the best of intentions and pray it will have the impact we all hope for.

Legally, meeting for religious worship is still an exemption to the general ban on leaving your home for non-essential travel. The proviso is that you only have direct contact with people in your bubble. The Stake President has confirmed that for now it is the general intention to still allow meetings to take place and be broadcast. 

Yet I would like to stress that we should only be attending these meetings in person if, first and foremost, you feel attending will not put you or anyone in your household at risk. You should not attend if someone you live with is under the new shielding regulations for example. You should also not share a car with anyone outside of your bubble either in order to get to church.

Secondly, we want to keep our numbers attending in person as low as possible to support the risk assessment so if you can administer the sacrament at home please do so. 

Brothers and Sisters we care about you and we all feel strongly the desire to be together and worship together. Yet I want to stress an eternal perspective. It is better for us to endure this limited time worshiping primarily in our homes so that long term we may all come back together and do so as a whole community in the long term.

If you have specific concerns or questions please contact a member of the Bishopric.

Also we will consolidate the online Sunday meeting schedule in order to allow families to have family time on the sabbath. Families with youth were finding that meetings at different times meant that throughout the sabbath there was always one of the family in a meeting. In response we are moving to having all of our sunday lessons starting at 11:30 instead.

So on the Sunday School week all ages of Sunday School will have their lessons start at 11:30. So like when we were at church we will have the lessons at the same time and finish about the same time. Then have the afternoon for personal and family time.

We will retain the late 19:45 Sunday school class for those who are unable to attend the 11:30 sessions or are teaching during that time.

On the other weeks Relief Society, Elders Quorum, Young Mens and Young Womens will all start at 11:30.

We hope this will help bring consolidation and unity and allow the sabbath to be a family day and a time of personal reflection as it should be.

If you have concerns please contact us directly.

## Sacrament meeting

We've been asked to be more detailed in our reporting of sacrament attendance. Two things you can do to help Fraser with that:
- When you are opening the sacrament broadcast please include "C3" when typing their name, eg. "Fraser C3"
- We'll assume that everyone who doesn't attend sacrament meetings at the chapel and doesn't watch the broadcast is holding their own sacrament meeting service at home. If you don't do any of those for some reason (e.g. travel, sickness, family visiting, etc) could you please let Fraser know - he doesn't need an explanation or details and will only use the information to adjust our ward's virtual sacrament attendance total.

## General

Do you have any smart devices that you no longer use and that are gathering dust? There are some who may not have one but could use one to join you in Sunday School or to watch the worship meetings this Christmas! If you have anything that you no longer need please let Luke Kerr, Helen Chisolm or Karolina Zachaczewska know and we will find a good place for them. If we have more than we need then we will give them to those who may need them in other wards!

## Primary

Please, keep an eye on the Facebook group and parents WhatsApp chat for the information about lessons, activities and videos to be posted, the handouts will be delivered to your home.

## Sunday School

The reason for putting on the two adult classes is that the feedback was that although 7.45pm is a good time for those who have young children who are by then are settling them down for the night it can be a little late in the evening for others. For those who do not have Zoom we do also have a paper-based Sunday School lesson available.  If you are not currently on the mailing list for this and would like to be added please text your name to Glyn Day on the following number 07399586123.

Thank you,

Sunday School Presidency.

The next Sunday school classes will take place on Sunday 17th January 2021.

Next year’s manuals have been distributed. If you haven’t received one, please contact brother Day.
